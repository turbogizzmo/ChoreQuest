    Determine if the user is eligible to spin today.

    Rules:
    1. A spin credit is earned for each day whose assignments are fully satisfied.
    2. Spin credits can be used later (carry-over), so late approvals still count.
    3. One spin result consumes one unspent credit day.

    Whether "satisfied" means parent-verified or just kid self-reported is
    controlled by the ``spin_requires_verification`` app setting (default: true).
    When true, only ``verified`` status counts — kids cannot game the wheel by
    tapping "Mark Done" on chores they haven't actually completed.
